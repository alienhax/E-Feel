The five-bedroom, five-and-one-half-bath estate at 6410 North Bay Rd., a project by noted architect LeRoy K. Albert, has been meticulously renovated, creating a uniquely appealing residence designed to please the most discriminating palette. The residence\u2019s generously scaled open layout boasts 5,035 square feet of interior living space, and landscaped grounds encompass a sprawling 24,000 square feet.<br>A wide circular driveway features coral keystone and serves as a graceful approach to the front of the two-story home. Lush hedges enhance the sense of privacy, and tall palms underscore the tropical beauty of the estate. Inside, impeccably crafted formal and informal areas are accented by marble and wood flooring, high wood-beam ceilings and floor-to-ceiling impact windows that flood the home with natural light. At once sleek, inviting and practical, the gourmet-style eat-in kitchen is outfitted with marble countertops, double sinks, a Fisher & Paykel gas stove and oven, an espresso and cappuccino maker, and a Sub-Zero refrigerator. While the living room and spacious formal dining room are well suited for grand scale entertaining, both the playroom \u2014 adjacent to the kitchen \u2014 and the family room are ideal for more casual gatherings of family and friends. Expansive use of balconies, windows and glass doors open the home to picturesque exterior spaces, capturing the essence of breezy South Florida living. All bedrooms are large, with the master suite offering a wall-to-wall walk-in closet, double vanities, a Jacuzzi tub and two private balconies.<br>Outside, the luxury motif continues with covered and exposed terraces, a heated pool and a pier dock with lift. Additional amenities include maid\u2019s quarters, a laundry room, surround sound, a full-house generator, a two-car garage and an outdoor storage room.<br>","youtube_url":"","main_photo":"A2024325_265006.jpg","title":"Fabulous MIMO Waterfront Home","photos":[{"id":"265006","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265006.jpg","caption":"Exterior front","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 16:22:00","display_index":"1"},{"id":"265007","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265007.jpg","caption":"Dock","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 16:22:00","display_index":"2"},{"id":"265008","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265008.jpg","caption":"View","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 16:22:00","display_index":"3"},{"id":"265009","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265009.jpg","caption":"Back","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 16:22:00","display_index":"4"},{"id":"265010","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265010.jpg","caption":"Yard","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 16:22:00","display_index":"5"},{"id":"265011","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265011.jpg","caption":"Living room","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 16:22:00","display_index":"6"},{"id":"265012","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265012.jpg","caption":"Proposed rendering","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 16:22:00","display_index":"7"},{"id":"265016","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265016.jpg","caption":"kitchen","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"8"},{"id":"265017","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265017.jpg","caption":"Bathroom","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"9"},{"id":"265018","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265018.jpg","caption":"master bedroom","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"10"},{"id":"265019","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265019.jpg","caption":"Bathroom","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"11"},{"id":"265020","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265020.jpg","caption":"Bedroom","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"12"},{"id":"265021","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265021.jpg","caption":"Pool view","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"13"},{"id":"265022","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265022.jpg","caption":"Theater room","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"14"},{"id":"265023","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265023.jpg","caption":"Exterior back","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"15"},{"id":"265024","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265024.jpg","caption":"view","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:58:00","display_index":"16"},{"id":"265025","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_265025.jpg","caption":"Yard","date_uploaded":"2014-10-27 17:59:00","display_index":"17"},{"id":"268489","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_268489.jpg","caption":"NEW Main Photo","date_uploaded":"2014-12-03 18:21:00","display_index":"18"},{"id":"275587","mls_num":"A2024325","photo_url":"A2024325_275587.jpg","caption":"New Pool View","date_uploaded":"2015-02-11 14:05:00","display_index":"19"}],"list_price_text":"$12,500,000","square_feet_text":"5,035","openhouse":false,"ewm_pic_count":19},"arr_agent_details":{"id":"431","branch":"Miami Beach","last_name":"Gonzalez, P.A.","first_name":"Nelson","cell_phone":"","home_phone":"","other_phone":"","fax":"305-674-4095","email":"Nelson@NelsonGonzalez.com","email_fwd":"","office_did":"305-674-4040","quote":"\"The ONLY address for luxury real estate\"  www.NelsonGonzalez.com","broker_code":"EWM 04","home_page":"http:\/\/www.NelsonGonzalez.com","title":"Associate","bio":"<div>As Senior Vice President with EWM Realtors, Nelson has enjoyed over 20 years of success selling luxury real estate on Miami Beach and other areas of Dade County.

I count 'Ironman races'' as one of my fun past times! (yes, that is the insanely long triathlon) so if you see me on Key Biscayne running, swimming or cycling give me a wave of encouragement. &nbsp;I always look to deliver 100% and this focus and drive is typical of what I give to ALL my clients.

The proverbial \u2018signatures\u2019 of this home are the outdoor living spaces - attractions in and of themselves. Covered terraces with vaulted ceilings, outdoor fireplace, summer kitchen, infinity edge pool & spa, and grassy knolls graciously settle along the quiet, picturesque lagoon.  <br><br>A rectangular \u2018old world\u2019 kitchen is inarguably the heart of the home.  Created with coved ceilings on each end and a vaulted brick ceiling in the center, seating arrangements are sprinkled at the three points. Colombian hardwoods are used extensively in the kitchen complex which includes an enormous family room, 7-seat wet bar, and wine cellar with tasting table & chairs. An impressive foyer entry, glass encased formal dining room with outdoor vistas, grand formal living room with a two-sided wood burning fireplace, and an \u2018over-the-top\u2019 office with two working stations and three sitting areas complete the first level.  <br><br>A gorgeous staircase created with forged ironwork and limestone leads to the second level and bedroom suites.  Each exquisite bedroom overlooks lush gardens and lagoon, and can be further enjoyed on outdoor verandas, corridors, and covered terrace.  Guests enjoy quiet stay in a two-room suite separate from the main house; attached by exterior breezeway or accessed with private staircase.  Two generously sized service quarters, each with bath, are adjacent to main house and perfectly located alongside each carriage house.<br><br>181 Leucadendra Drive was a labor of love completed in 2004, and has every amenity imaginable. It\u2019s a \u201csmart house\u201d with elevator, gas generator, impact glass, full-service dock, boat lift, and numerous other unparalleled details. A symphony of Colombian hardwoods, brushed Colombian limestone and Argentinian \u201cPorfirio\u201d cobblestone floors, stone, and forged ironworks are the backdrop of this 21st century \u201cOld World\u201d home.  <br><br>Wonderfully located within the Gables Estates community of Coral Gables, this very special residence on 48,274SF of coveted land lies on a quiet, no traffic \u201cU\u201d shaped alcove off Leucadendra Drive, with private tennis courts just steps away (tennis membership included).
